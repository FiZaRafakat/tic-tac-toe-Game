## How to Play

### Game Overview
Tic Tac Toe is played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking empty boxes with their symbol ('O' or 'X'). The first to align three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins. If all boxes are filled with no winner, it's a draw.

### Game Modes

   - The game ends when either player wins or the grid is full with no winner (draw).

2. **Two Player**
   - Player 1 is 'O' and Player 2 is 'X'.
   - Players alternate turns marking the boxes.
   - The game ends when either player wins or the grid is full with no winner (draw).
